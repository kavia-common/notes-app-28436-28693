## Tables Created

1. **users** - User accounts and authentication
   - Columns: id, username, email, password_hash, created_at, updated_at
   - Indexes: Primary key (id), Unique index (email)
   - Status: ✓ Schema verified

2. **notes** - User notes
   - Columns: id, user_id, title, content, created_at, updated_at
   - Foreign Key: user_id → users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
   - Indexes: Primary key (id), Index (user_id)
   - Status: ✓ Schema verified

3. **summaries** - AI-generated note summaries
   - Columns: id, note_id, summary_text, created_at
   - Foreign Key: note_id → notes(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
   - Indexes: Primary key (id), Index (note_id)
   - Status: ✓ Schema verified

4. **audit_logs** - Audit trail for actions
   - Columns: id, user_id, action, entity, entity_id, timestamp, details
   - Foreign Key: user_id → users(id) ON DELETE SET NULL
   - Indexes: Primary key (id), Index (user_id)
   - Status: ✓ Schema verified

5. **alembic_version** - Alembic migration tracking
   - Current version: 6d7b456c59b7
   - Status: ✓ Up to date

## Verification Tests Passed

- ✓ Alembic migration at head revision (6d7b456c59b7)
- ✓ All 5 tables created successfully (users, notes, summaries, audit_logs, alembic_version)
- ✓ Users table schema verified with correct columns and indexes
- ✓ Notes table schema verified with foreign key to users
- ✓ Summaries table schema verified with foreign key to notes
- ✓ Audit logs table schema verified with foreign key to users
- ✓ All foreign key constraints properly configured
- ✓ All indexes created as specified
- ✓ Database connection successful on port 5000
- ✓ Alembic version table correctly tracking migration state

## Environment Configuration

The .env file has been configured with:
- DATABASE_URL=postgresql+asyncpg://appuser:dbuser123@localhost:5000/myapp
- ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES=500
- PREVIEW_NO_AUTH=true
- All other required environment variables set

## Alembic Configuration

The alembic setup includes:
- **alembic.ini**: Configured with script location and logging
- **alembic/env.py**: Properly handles asyncpg URL conversion to psycopg2 for migrations
- **SSL Mode**: Disabled for local development (sslmode=disable)
- **Migration Script**: 6d7b456c59b7_initial_migration_users_notes_summaries_.py

## Migration Details

The migration creates all required tables with:
- Proper data types (INTEGER, VARCHAR, TEXT, TIMESTAMP)
- NOT NULL constraints where appropriate
- Primary keys on all tables
- Foreign keys with CASCADE and SET NULL behaviors
- Indexes for performance optimization
- Unique constraints where needed (e.g., email in users table)

## Next Steps

The database schema is fully initialized and ready for use. The backend application can now:
- Register and authenticate users
- Create, read, update, and delete notes
- Store and retrieve AI summaries
- Log audit events

## Notes

- The database listens on port 5000 (as verified in verification tests)
- SSL mode is disabled for local development (sslmode=disable in alembic env.py)
- The database uses asyncpg driver for async operations in the application
- Alembic uses psycopg2 (sync driver) for migrations, which is the standard approach
- All migrations completed successfully without errors
- Schema integrity verified through SQLAlchemy inspector
