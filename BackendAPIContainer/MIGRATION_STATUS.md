# Database Migration Status

## Migration Applied Successfully ✓

**Date:** 2025-01-16  
**Migration Version:** 6d7b456c59b7  
**Migration Name:** Initial migration: users, notes, summaries, audit_logs

## Database Configuration

- **Database URL:** postgresql+asyncpg://appuser:dbuser123@localhost:5000/myapp
- **Database Port:** 5000 (PostgreSQL)
- **Visualizer Port:** 5001 (Web UI)

## Tables Created

1. **users** - User accounts and authentication
   - Columns: id, username, email, password_hash, created_at, updated_at
   - Indexes: Primary key (id), Unique index (email)

2. **notes** - User notes
   - Columns: id, user_id, title, content, created_at, updated_at
   - Foreign Key: user_id → users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
   - Indexes: Primary key (id), Index (user_id)

3. **summaries** - AI-generated note summaries
   - Columns: id, note_id, summary_text, created_at
   - Foreign Key: note_id → notes(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
   - Indexes: Primary key (id), Index (note_id)

4. **audit_logs** - Audit trail for actions
   - Columns: id, user_id, action, entity, entity_id, timestamp, details
   - Foreign Key: user_id → users(id) ON DELETE SET NULL
   - Indexes: Primary key (id), Index (user_id)

5. **alembic_version** - Alembic migration tracking
   - Current version: 6d7b456c59b7

## Verification Tests Passed

- ✓ Alembic migration executed successfully
- ✓ All tables created with correct schema
- ✓ Foreign key constraints properly configured
- ✓ Database connection from backend successful
- ✓ Async SQLAlchemy queries working correctly
- ✓ User table query test passed (count: 0)

## Next Steps

The database schema is fully initialized and ready for use. The backend application can now:
- Register and authenticate users
- Create, read, update, and delete notes
- Store and retrieve AI summaries
- Log audit events

## Notes

- The .env file has been configured with the correct DATABASE_URL
- SSL mode is disabled for local development (sslmode=disable in alembic env.py)
- The database uses asyncpg driver for async operations in the application
- Alembic uses psycopg2 (sync driver) for migrations, which is the standard approach
